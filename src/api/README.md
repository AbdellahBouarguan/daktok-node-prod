# API Folder

This folder contains all the code related to the application's API. It is further divided into subfolders for better organization.

## Subfolders

* `/v1`: This folder contains the first version of the API. It is further divided into:
    * `/controllers`: Contains the controller files that handle the incoming requests and send back responses.
    * `/middlewares`: Contains middleware functions that are used to process requests before they reach the controllers.
    * `/routes`: Contains the route definitions for the API.
